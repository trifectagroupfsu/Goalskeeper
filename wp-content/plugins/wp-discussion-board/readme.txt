Add a simple discussion board or more advanced forums to your site - users can post new topics and reply to existing ones.

== Description ==

Discussion Board is an easy way to add a discussion board, message board or forum to your WordPress site. The plugin creates a new post type, allows you to add a front-end log-in and registration form and decide who has access to your Discussion Board. It's ideal for people running:

* Community forums
* School or other education sites
* Training websites
* Support forums
* Niche sites
* Discussion groups
* Question and answer sites
* Technical forums
* Ecommerce sites
* Bulletin boards
* Job boards

Users can post their own topics via the front-end form and reply to topics posted by others. Each topic features on its own page and you can list all topics via the archive template or the included shortcode.

As the owner of the site, you can choose whether new topics should be published immediately or held as draft in order for you to moderate them. You can:

* Use standard WordPress settings to determine moderation levels for comments
* Specify roles for users who are permitted to post content
* Specify different roles for users permitted to view content
* Allow anyone to view the content but only permit specific user roles to post content

> <strong>Discussion Board Pro</strong><br><br>
> Discussion Board has a pro version which gives you more features, including:<br>
> * Multiple Discussion Boards for different subjects<br>
> * Set statuses for topics, e.g. 'Resolved', 'Open', etc<br>
> * Categories and tags<br>
> * Image uploads<br>
> * User profiles<br>
> * Topic following (subscribe to topics)<br>
> * WYSIWYG editor<br><br>

1. Go to Plugins > Add New
1. Search for 'Discussion Board'
1. Activate Discussion Board form the Plugins page
1. Go to Discussion Board > Settings to update any settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed Discussion Board. Now what do I do? =

Discussion Board will automatically install three pages for you:

* A page with a log-in and registration form
* A page with a form for users to post new topics
* A page listing existing topics

There are further, detailed instructions for the free and pro versions on [the website](https://discussionboard.pro/documentation/ "Discussion Board").

= Where can I see a demo? =

There's [a demo here](http://discussionboard.catapultthemes.com/ "Discussion Board Demo") and [a pro demo here](https://discussionboard.pro/  "Discussion Board Pro"). Feel free to register and post some content so that you can see how it works from the user's point of view.

= Some users are reporting that they don't receive an activation email =

In the first instance, ask them to check their spam/junk folders. If you've tested and you're certain emails aren't getting through, use the Postman SMTP plugin or similar to assist the delivery of email from your site. It's a more reliable way of ensuring emails are sent and received.

= Do I need to enable registration on my site? =

No.

= I see an error message about invalid post type. What's that? =

In your dashboard, just go to Settings > Permalinks. Then everything should be fine.

= Help, I can't seem to log out. Why? =

We've included a helpful log-in / log-out shortcode to display a log-in / log-out link. Use a plugin like Shortcode Widget and add the [discussion_board_log_in_out] shortcode to your sidebar or other widget area of your choice. The plugin also automatically displays a log-out link under the new topic form.

= My shortcodes display as shortcodes, not as the content they're supposed to render. Why? =

Be careful if you are copying and pasting the shortcodes - you might need to delete `<code>` tags. Click on the 'Text' tab in your content editor to see if these tags are there.
